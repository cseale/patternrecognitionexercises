% Exercise 9.3
% (a) The tell us the distance between the different clusters. For average
% distance, the distance between the geometric means of the different
% clusters is calculated. The biggest jumps in distance from the dendrogram
% are for 2,3 and 14 clusters respectively

% (b)

% (c)
% Rule of thumb, if the distance between a cluster means is greater then 3 
% times that of the points within the cluster to that clusters mean
