% the distance between large clusters is more pronouced than with complete

interactclust(+a,'a')
% different distances are pronouced and different clustering as performed
% at the top level with the different types of distance measuring across
% dimensions


% as you go from single > average > complete linkage, your linkage becomes
% more spherical
